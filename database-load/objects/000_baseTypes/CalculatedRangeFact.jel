/**
 * CalculatedFact is a Fact that computes a range of values, from other properties.
 * A calculated fact may have arguments which must correspond to other property names of the same database entry. They need to be declared in the dependencies property.
 * In addition to the Thing's facts, the following argument names are also supported and will be provided if included:
 *  - currentTime: the time for which the assertion should be validated, as timestamp
 *  - currentDate: the date/time for which the assertion should be validated, as LocalDateTime
 *  - currentLocation: the current location which is being validated, as Geo::ElevatedPosition
