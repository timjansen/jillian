Next steps
===========

1. 
- import IL::Verb   // same as let Verb=IL::Verb
- import IL::*      // imports all of IL
- document




3. IL
-> Merge IngVerb and SentenceObject!
-> construct for calendar elements relative to now, e.g. next week, last week, next 2 weeks, in 4 weeks...

- support clauses with 'but...', 'except...' ...
- support complex objects like '...not fast, but slowly'
- support prepositions ('from here', 'to there', 'without this')
- support 'he is interested in learning X'

5. Use regular context in translators, get rid of translatorDict

6. Split repository into JEL/Ed?

7. write translators English->IL


9. write IL simplifier:
      - replace pronouns
      - simplify sentences and put them on a timeline
      - translate simplified IL into new DB manipulation language

Example conversation:
The ball is red.          => upsert a Fact that the ball is red 
Or blue.                  => change the previous fact to red OR blue
But that's just a guess.  => change the certainty of the previous fact.


11. Add method overloading, to allow something like

fib(n: 0)=>0
fib(n: 1)=>1
fib(n: number) => this.fib(n-1) + this.fib(n-2)

If two or more methods have the same name, but different signature, create an overloading method that dispatches to the implementation.
Must have same arg names.


12. 'function' keyword???

function add(a, b)=>a+b

For overloading:

function fib(n: 0)=>0
         fib(n: 1)=>1
         fib(n: number) => this.fib(n-1) + this.fib(n-2)

or new operator '|>'?

function fib(n: 0)=>0
|>          (n: 1)=>1
|>          (n: number) => this.fib(n-1) + this.fib(n-2)



18. Allow operator overriding only to be implemented in JEL!? Even native classes should implement them as JEL, and provide native methods to allow implementing them.


19. Add function parameter to stacktrace
- JelObject needs new toDetailedString(l: DetailLevel) with DetailLevel.VERY, SOME... etc... numbers are always printed, string and lists only up to a certain length. Most JelObjects default to CTORNAME(...)


20. Find a way to document types: /** */ Javadocs supported in Tokenizer. Read them in JEL.parseClass and store in new ClassDef field.
   Use 'private' modifier in docs
   

50. Improve Fact evaluations. when determining a fact, check whether the Fact is compatible with all Facts with higher trustworthyness. Aim for the most specific Fact that passes the test.




Colors
======
Class to store color (RGB?). 
Name color and hue.
https://www.color-blindness.com/color-name-hu



Reader
=======
Uses Translators to translate english into JIL.

Use new natural.TreebankWordTokenizer() for tokenization?  // https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural



JEL Improvements
================
Python-like list comprehension? 
[x for x in y if x>1]

Or pipelines??

myList as m -> m.age>=18 -> m.name
means myList.filter(m=>m.age>=18).map(m=>m.name) 



Fact Evaluation
================
The Fact evaluation should be much better. It should evaluate all facts and identify contradictions, especially between Thing and Category facts



Long Term Todos and Shortcuts taken
====================================
- ApproximateNumber does not always calculate the error correctly, e.g. not for the ^ operator
- Fractions could make better use of ^ operator



Test sentences
================

Winnie the Pooh Test Sentence:
In after-years he liked to think that he had been in Very Great Danger during the Terrible Flood, but the only danger he had 
really been in was the last half-hour of his imprisonment, when Owl, who had just flown up, sat on a branch of his tree to comfort him, 
and told him a very long story about an aunt who had once laid a seagull's egg by mistake, and the story went on and on, rather like this 
sentence, until Piglet who was listening out of his window without much hope, went to sleep quietly and naturally, slipping slowly out of 
the window towards the water until he was only hanging on by his toes, at which moment, luckily, a sudden loud squawk from Owl, which was 
really part of the story, being what his aunt said, woke the Piglet up and just gave him time to jerk himself back into safety and say, 
"How interesting, and did she?" when — well, you can imagine his joy when at last he saw the good ship, Brain of Pooh coming over the sea to rescue him...

Understanding
----------------
 The ball didn’t fit in the brown suitcase because it was too
       a. small
       b. big

 Does it refer to the ball or the suitcase?
