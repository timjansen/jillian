////// Time type

// Simplified
'past'   // at some point in the past. Depends on time-context, e.g. in a story, that's something that happened prior to the story
'future' // at some point in the future. Depends on time-context, e.g. in a story, that's something that happened prior after the story
'now'    // at the time-context

// Unspecified time
{unspecified: 'past'}
{unspecified: 'now'}

// Calendar-based with tz
{year: 2010, month: 5, zone: 'est'} // month with tz, accuracy range is the whole month
{year: 2010, month: 5, day: 1, zone: 'est'} // day with tz, accuracy range is the whole day
{year: 2010, month: 5, day: 2, hour: 5, minute: 16, zone: 'est'}, // accurancy range is the minute
{year: 2010, month: 5, day: 2, hour: 5, minute: 16, zone: 'est', accuracy: 300}, // by minute but more accuracy (5min)

// Calendar-based without tz
{year: 2010, month: 5} // month with tz, accurancy range is the whole month for all timezones
{year: 2010, month: 5, day: 1} // day with tz, accurancy range is the whole day for all timezones
{year: 2010, month: 5, day: 2, hour: 5, minute: 16}, // by minute, accurancy range is the whole minute for across all timezones

// Timestamp
{timestamp: 454359845988} // ms since epoch. Float. ms accuracy.
{timestamp: 454359845988, accuracy: 60000} // 60s accuracy
454359845988             // simplified timestamp

// Relative
{relative: {duration: 25502 /*duration spec*/}, reference: '@etMovie'} // in relation to a reference-specific time, e.g. start of movie

// Sequence-based
{sequence: 2, reference: '@empireStateBuilding'} // to order events by sequence if no exact time is known. Uses floats, so "1.5" would be before 2 and after 1.

// Combined relative/sequence
{relative: {duration: 25502}, sequence: 2, reference: '@etMovie'}

// Combined calendar/sequence
{year: 2017, month: 1, day: 1, sequence: 2, reference: '@someEvent'}

// Expression with more details
{expression: /*day='friday' and dayOfMonth=13*/}                      // undefined Friday 13th
{unspecified: 'past', expression: /*day='friday' and dayOfMonth=13*/} // some past Friday 13th
