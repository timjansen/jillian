////// Shape type

// The 2D/3D shape of a thing, as approximation. 
// Note that it should be really only a approximation. E.g. a car can be represented by a cubid. A more detailed representation requires components.

// Properties
		categoryVariations: 'fixed' or 'typical'
		baseLength: lengthType, optional: the length of the given shape, so it can be scaled using min/max dimensions
		form: either 'ellipse' (2d), 'polygon' (2d), 'cubid', 'sphere', 'conicalFrustrum' or 'polyhedron' (3d shapes)

		vertices: one or more positionType. Needed for polygon, cube, polyhedron
		polygons: number, lists of vertice numbers
		center: positionType, for ellipse, sphere, conicalFrustrum (center of base)
		shortRadius: lengthType, for ellipse, cubid, sphere, conicalFrustrum (for base)
		longRadius: lengthType, for ellipse, cubid, sphere, conicalFrustrum (for base)
		frustrumShortRadius: lengthType, for conicalFrustrum's top
		frustrumLongRadius: lengthType, for conicalFrustrum's top
		angle: angleType, allows to change the default orientation
