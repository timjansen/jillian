The Empire State Building is a skyscraper in New York City, United States.
It is 381 meters tall and has 102 floors, and the height to its pinnacle is 1454 feet. 
Named after the popular nickname for New York, The Empire State, it is one of the most famous landmarks in the US.
Designed by the architects named Shreve, Lamb & Harmon Associates, it was built at a time when many people were trying to make the world's tallest building, but the Empire State Building won. 
It was completed in 410 days. 
It opened on May 1, 1931, when United States President Herbert Hoover pushed a button in Washington, D.C. to turn on the lights. 
The Empire State Building's design was based on the 21-story Reynolds Building in Winston-Salem, which was built in 1929.
The Empire State Building became the tallest building in New York City and the world, holding this record for forty-one years, until the first World Trade Center towers opened in 1973. 
When these towers were brought down in the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Empire State Building was again the tallest building in New York. 
It lost this title in April 2013 when the new One World Trade Center surpassed it, which is now the tallest building in the US and the Western Hemisphere.
On Saturday, July 28, 1945, the B-25 Empire State Building crash started a fire.
The building was not structurally compromised. 
14 people were killed in the accident.
Equality operations never throw exceptions.
The world of energy is changing, and that transformation is occurring at a rapidly expanding rate.
Although the continued and growing use of fossil fuel is not the only area of concern, it is at the heart of the protests. 
Although not amongst the global top 20 when it comes to revenue, we have witnessed the recent rebranding of a Norwegian oil major, Statoil as Equinor.
Chad Haag considered living in a cave to escape his student debt. 
He had a friend doing it. 
But after some plotting, he settled on what he considered a less risky plan. 
This year, he relocated to a jungle in India. 
The first work he found after he left the University of Northern Colorado in 2011 — when the recession’s effects were still palpable — was on-again, off-again hours at a factory, unloading trucks and constructing toy rockets on an assembly line.
He then went back to school to pursue a master’s degree in comparative literature at the University of Colorado Boulder.
After that, he tried to make it as an adjunct professor, but still he could barely scrape a living together with the one class a semester he was assigned.
